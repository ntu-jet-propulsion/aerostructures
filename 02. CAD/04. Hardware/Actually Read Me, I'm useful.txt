Hello!

Hardware is something standardised so its best practice to not make it yourself, and if you do try to make it only once.

In solidworks, make sure you have the solidworks toolbox addin loaded so you can access the whole nuts and bolts repository.

If you need to make a u-bolt or eyebolt, try to buy lots of the same eyebolt from one supplier to ensure consistence.
